05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to have a scheduler for your work day. This challange's purpose is to take what we have learned about 3rd party APIs and intagrate them into a site.

## Useage 

The site has a very simple layput that is straight foward and easy to use. Simply click the timeblock you would like to add and event or task to and start typing. When you have entered everything you wish to add, click the save button on that timeblock and repeat this process for as many time blocks as you would like to add info to. As the day progresses you will notice the color of the time block begining to change. Green timeblocks indicate that hour has yet to pass, red means that is the hour of day you are curently in, ad gray indicates that hour has already passed. To remove text from the timeblock, highlight the text in the timeblock, delete it, and then make sure to save the empty timeblock so the info does not persist.
